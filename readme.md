# solana-developer-bootcamp-2025 (anchor-0.31.1 version)

Since the current github.com:solana-developers/developer-bootcamp-2024.git uses an older version of Anchor (0.30.0), but the current version of Anchor is 0.31.1 (4th June 2025), I decided to create a new tutorial.
I'm a Solana newbie with a good amount of experience with EVM, Solidity, and TypeScript. So by the end of the tutorial, we shall all be Solana experts ;)

I advise you to actually don't vibe code here. Do it the hard way, so you actually understand the fundamentals. Otherwise you will exchange short term productivity (it's not productive, it's just a tutorial) over long term learning.

You can always use and ask LLMs questions about fundamentals. I strongly encourage you to do so. But be aware as for now, that the amount of public information about Solana is still limited. If Ethereum is a dark forest, then I can tell you that Solana is darker ;). The LLM just doesn't have enough training data available yet. Most of the Solana contracts are completely closed. Let's change that together. BTW: companies like 1inch are leading here the way, shout out to them. Check out: https://github.com/1inch/solana-fusion-protocol and https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-solana/. Thank you guys!
